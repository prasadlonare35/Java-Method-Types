# Java Method Types 🚀

This repository contains 4 Java programs demonstrating the **four fundamental types of methods** in Java, categorized by the presence of input and output.

These programs are part of my **DSA learning journey in Java**, focusing on how methods (functions) behave under different input/output combinations.

## 📚 Method Types Covered

| Type | Description                   | Input | Output |
|------|-------------------------------|-------|--------|
| 1️⃣   | No input, No output            | ❌    | ❌     |
| 2️⃣   | No input, But output           | ❌    | ✅     |
| 3️⃣   | Input, But no output           | ✅    | ❌     |
| 4️⃣   | Input and output both          | ✅    | ✅     |

## 🔍 Files Included

- `Type1.java` – Method with **no input & no output**
- `Type2.java` – Method with **no input but with output**
- `Type3.java` – Method with **input but no output**
- `Type4.java` – Method with **input and output both**
